This is great to show the working PCB or the ISDN prototype board
connected to our IPBX prototype through the LEB and TDM bus of our SoC
(INTEL Tolapai). This PCB shows the 4 T0 ports routed to the CologneChip
XHFC-4SU. We have been cabling this PCB in a factory facility close to
Paris with good results on the quality of the cabling for 230+ parts on
our PCB with 4 layers.
