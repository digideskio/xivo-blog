You may now user ccmanager to manage your \#xivo contact center agents.

In addition to drag and drop in ccmanager main window, agents can be
easily added in a queue with a specific penalty, penalty can be changed
for any queue, and the agent can be removed from a queue.

Just click on the little pen on the main screen agent box, and the agent
configuration windows pops up.

Xuc is available on [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/groups/xuc "gitlab") doc
