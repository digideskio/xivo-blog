Those who are using an IDE were all using Eclipse. It's a great IDE
supporting multiple languages. About one year ago, we experienced some
issues with Eclipse and Scala - increased memory consumption and,
probably as a consequence, stability problems. Then we gave a try to the
IntelliJ IDEA community edition. Thanks to its Scala and Java features
we moved one by one from Eclipse to IDEA. Let's have a look why and what
we miss.

Interesting features- automatic plugin proposition based on the file
extension- auto-complete with priorized list, the right option is
somehow usually on the top of the list- almost all can be done by the
keyboard, navigation between the code, structure, project files...- fast
start and restart- useful community edition- automatic save- power save
mode- licensing options for open source projects

What could be improved- automatic hide or semi-hide of tool windows- we
haven't found the tool window with errors and warnings
