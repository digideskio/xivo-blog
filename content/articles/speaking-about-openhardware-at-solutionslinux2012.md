The last **"SolutionsLinux2012"** fair in Paris was the occasion once
again (as we keep the tradition to have a booth there) to present our
latest developments for XiVO and the current deployments we have in
France and elsewhere. This year, **the local web TV** was giving many
interesting interviews of OpenSource people (you can follow the Flo2sTV
channel [here](http://www.youtube.com/user/Flo2sTV "here") and the
twitter of Philippe Scoffoni
[there](https://twitter.com/pscoffoni "Philippe Scoffoni twitter")).

We had the opportunity to give an **interview about the OpenHardware
movement current status** (sorry the interview is in french) and some
insights of the projects and products that are available out-there, as
well as the description of an OpenHardware.
