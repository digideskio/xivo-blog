Here are a few links explaining what we are going to ship in XiVO 15.06:

-   [Roadmap](https://projects.xivo.io/versions/222 "https://projects.xivo.io/versions/222")

XiVO 15.06 brings changes into the XiVO Client, visual and functional
changes among which:

-   the identity xlet's transformation continued
-   the fax xlet has been revamped
-   the tabber has been revamped

This version also fixes 8 bugs.

Technical matters :

-   xivo-provd was splitted into multiple git repositories :
    xivo-provisioning, xivo-provd-client and xivo-provd-cli. The later
    replaces the deprecated xivo-provd-pycli, the command line
    interpreter for provd.
-   xivo-agent was renamed to xivo-agentd to be coherent with the
    general naming convention.
-   xivo-agent-ctl was renamed to xivo-agentd-cli to be coherent with
    the general naming convention.

You can consult [upgrade
notes](http://documentation.xivo.io/en/latest/upgrade/upgrade.html#id1 "Upgrade Notes")
for this version.
