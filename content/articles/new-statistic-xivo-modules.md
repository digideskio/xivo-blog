I'm very proud to announce our **new statistics module for XiVO**.
Please see a first screenshot of this module below :

As you can see, we have integrated a full statistic module for our next
major version, Skaro. All existing statistics queues in Asterisk (GPLv3)
are not really usable and not suitable for a call center. Our previous
version is using Asternic with a lack of performances in the free
software version and namely in terms if counters from our customers
point of view.

We are implementing a cache system to have real-time results and stats.
The Asterisk queue CSV files can be importable within this module. In
order to produce graphics, we are using the jqplot library that gives us
very decent results.
