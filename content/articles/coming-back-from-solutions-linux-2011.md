We had to opportunity to demonstrate our prototype of the XiVO IPBX
OpenHardware with 3 different phones connected to the appliance
(original orange french Socotel S63 analog phone, Siemens Gigaset SX353
ISDN phone and Aastra 6731i SIP phone) and available through our
softwitch interface.The mini-conference was also the opportunity to
exchange with different hardware engineers in the telecommunications
field about OpenHardware designs and PCB fabs in Europe. We hope this
will help the telco OpenHardware community to grow in the coming months.
