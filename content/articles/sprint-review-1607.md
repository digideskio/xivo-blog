Hello XiVO community! Here comes the release of XiVO 16.07!

New features in this sprint

Community contributions
-----------------------

**Tutorials**: Many thanks for Ward Mundy from http://nerdvittles.com for creating many new tutorials for XiVO.


Ongoing features
----------------

**Call Transfers**: We are working on a new API for managing call transfers. This will offer third parties more flexibility when developing applications that control the call flows, such as a Web Switchboard. In addition, this new API should solve a number of bugs related to call transfers. In this iteration we started a version of xivo-ctid that uses this new API for all xivo client transfer.

See you at the next sprint review!
