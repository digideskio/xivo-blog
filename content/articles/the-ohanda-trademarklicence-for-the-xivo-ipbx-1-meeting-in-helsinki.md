**I just got back from the Pixelache Festival in Helsinki** (1) where we
had a OHANDA (2) meeting with the founding members of the OHANDA
initiative (Juergen Neumann from Freifunk in Berlin and Tuomo Tammenpää
from Yatta in Helskinki) in order to discuss the next steps for the
usage of the **OHANDA licence/trademark** with OpenHardware projects.

The OHANDA licence/trademark is definitely the most advanced initiative
so far after the work we had done on the OpenHardwareInitiative and
presented at the OpenTechSummit 2008 (3) in Taiwan with different
hardware projects (OpenMoko, OpenPattern, ...) looking for an umbrella
for their licence adapting the GPL licences used for FOSS projects.

A first presentation of the OHANDA licence/trademark had been done at
GOSH and PIKSEL (4) with the organization of the trademark and the
relations between hardware designer and users/clients as described below
:

This is a great opportunity for the **XiVO IPBX OpenHardware project to
apply this up-coming licence/trademark** to the future product (product
registered with a **unique OHANDA \#ID**) and garantee a common
umbrellas for multiple OpenHardware projects.

We will documente the next steps in the OHANDA licence/trademark
setting-up for the XiVO IPBX OpenHardware project in order to make
available the different files of the project and the registration \#ID
to follow the updates from the OHANDA trademark.
