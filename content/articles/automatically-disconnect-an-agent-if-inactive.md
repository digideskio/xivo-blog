Hello, my name is Nicolas (h4wk3r on irc #xivo). I am a currently alternating between my studies for
a Master in Computer Engineering and my work in a call center. I could not find any information in
the XiVO CTI when a phone was disconnected, so I worked on a solution for generating this
information. This allows agents to know their phone's status.

Let us imagine the following scenario: An agent in a call center is connected with is softphone 'N.
SIP XXX'. He logs in via his XiVO Client in order to receive calls from his assigned queues. One of
the following 3 events occurs :

A – The softphone is disconnected from asterisk .
B – The agent finishes his day, turns off his softphone but forgets to disconnect his XiVO Client
C – The agent is at home, the VPN tunnel stops

In these 3 examples, the agent cannot know if he can still recieve calls because he does not recieve
any alerts from his XiVO client or from the phone.

I. Standard operation
=====================

Agent's point of view
---------------------------

Point of view on the XiVO Server
--------------------------------

II. Anomaly
===========

Agent's point of view
---------------------------

Let us simulate the anomaly. For this simulation, the softphone has been forcefully disconnected.

![photo 3]({filename}/public/agent_disconnect/photo3.png)

**We can see that our agent is still logged in and no other information about the disconnection is
displayed**

Agent's point of view
---------------------------

![photo 4]({filename}/public/agent_disconnect/photo4.png)

We can see that the state of extension 741 is ```UNKNOWN```, but agent 6002 (extension 728) is still
connected.

III. Execution of the script
============================

The script will find out that the SIP account is disconnected and will automatically log out the
agent associated to the extension.

Accordingly, the agent now knows that he is logged out:

This script has been deployed in production and has been working successfully since Oct 1st 2015.
You can download this script on [github](https://github.com/h4wk3r/XIVO-Agentoff_if_sipoff).
