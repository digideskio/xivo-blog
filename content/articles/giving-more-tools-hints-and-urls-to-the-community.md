In the world of the OpenHardware projects, we do aim at giving to the
community more hints about prototyping hardware, understanding (also
reversing) existing hardware, hacking (in the sense of modifying and
adding more unexpected features) equipments, reusing "old" hardware and
sharing production and lab facilities. The last years had seen a number
of blogs and URLs in this field such as:

-   **[Name that ware](http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/)**: The famous
    blog from BunnyStudios that post regularly a pictures of a PCB where
    you should discover the name of the original electronic
    products behind. Bunny is also the hardware developper behind
    the Chumby.
-   **[AdaFruit](http://www.adafruit.com/)**: A blog/portal dedicated to
    making some hardware devices (usually micro-controllers) and [a load
    of tutorials](http://www.adafruit.com/index.php?main_page=tutorials)
-   **[Sump](http://www.sump.org/projects/)** from Michael Poppitz who
    developed the hardware for the famous OpenBench LogicSniffer based
    on a FPGA that allows a very flexible LogicAnalyzer w/ up to
    32channels (16 on a H10-2.54mm header and 16 on-pcb) and 200MHz
    frequence sampling
-   **[DangerousPrototypes](http://dangerousprototypes.com/)**: A portal
    that proposes a new OpenHardware project everymonth and distributes
    numerous prototyping hardware and tools including some hints to
    [make your own laser-cut case](http://thinkl33t.co.uk/?p=316) for
    your OpenBench logic analyzer or PirateBus analyzer.
-   **[Hackmii](http://hackmii.com/)**: A hardware hacking blog
    dedicated mostly to the Wii hacking but with a lots of tutorials and
    hardware exploits and a link with forum that somehow more difficult
    to find.
