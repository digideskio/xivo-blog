**My impressions from this devroom :**

-   60+ people room always packed (with some people constraint to wait
    for the next talk outside :) )
-   3 people from Digium able to interact with the community about the
    Asterisk project
-   No video-streaming available as the smal devrooms were not equiped
-   Great presentations of the Kamalilio project that seems to be used
    in the GSM and VoIP core-network
-   People from UK, Spain, US, Germany ...
-   Some XiVO community users coming over to exchange about their user
    experiences
-   A link to my [XiVO IOH FOSDEM2011
    Presentation](http://carcelle.fu8.com/XiVO_IOH_Presentation_FOSDEM2011_06022011.pdf "XiVO IOH FOSDEM2011 Presentation")
    (40mns, Latex Beamer style)

**The main feebacks from the room :**

-   Availabiliy of more interfaces on the XiVO IPBX OpenHardware
-   Possible interaction with the development team of XiVO IPBX
-   Made-in-europe welcomed by the hardware geeks
-   Possible usage of the XiVO IPBX OpenHardware for larger VoIP
    deployments
-   Any future concurrent of CIRPACK in OpenHardwareÂ ? :)
