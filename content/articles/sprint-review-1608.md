Hello XiVO community! Here comes the release of XiVO 16.08!

New features in this sprint
---------------------------

**Provisioning**: The provisioning server has been reinforced to avoid attacks allowing to discover phone credentials that would allow an attacker to start phone calls without authorization. Thank you to Jean-Loup Depoisier from the XiVO community for bringing this problem to our attention.


Ongoing features
----------------

**Call Transfers**: We are working on a new API for managing call transfers. This will offer third parties more flexibility when developing applications that control the call flows, such as a Web Switchboard. In addition, this new API should solve a number of bugs related to call transfers. In this iteration we continued working on a version of the CTI server that uses this new API for all XiVO Client transfers.

See you at the next sprint review!
