For a second year, Avencall was present on the biggest Asterisk
conference in the world: Astricon.This year, the conference was held in
Georgia, Atlanta.

Like every year, the Monday is the AstriDevCon, a small conference for
developers by the developers to discuss the future and how to improve
Asterisk. It's a very nice place to get to know the other people that
are coding inside Asterisk and also to coordinate with others about what
has to be done.

You can find a nice resume of the whole day of discussion here:

As you can see, this year we also had a booth (\#28). It was a great
experience to expose ourself at Astricon because there is a huge flow of
people interested and interesting. It was a lot of fun to talk about the
XiVO project and the XiVO Open Hardware. All the gizmos we had on our
table really attracted may people, especially the raspberry pi that was
running XiVO.

To communicate further about us, we also gave a conference to present
Avencall and the XiVO telephony system.
