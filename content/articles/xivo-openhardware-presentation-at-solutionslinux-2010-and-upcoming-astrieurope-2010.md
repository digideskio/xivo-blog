Following the presentation we did at SolutionsLinux 2010 in Paris (**the
presentation we made is now available at (1)** and had been made in
french as the crowd was mainly french-speakers).

**We will be presenting the XiVO IPBX OpenHardware project at the
AstriEurope Conference in Paris** (2) next week on the first day and the
detailled program of the conferences is available here (3). The
conference will aim at giving the latest details on the hardware choices
and features.

The AstriEurope will be the occasion to have different presentations on
the various asterisk-oriented projects (software and hardware oriented)
currently available out-there with the presence of several people from
Digium supporting the event.
