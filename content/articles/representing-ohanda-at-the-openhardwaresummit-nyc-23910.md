We are very pleased to announce that we will be participating to the
**OpenHardwareSummit** ^\[<span
id="rev-pnote-33-1">[1](#pnote-33-1)</span>\]^ in New York (on Sept.
23rd) representing the OHANDA Trademark during a discussion panel called
**"LAW: Open hardware licenses and norms"** .This is a great opportunity
for us (OHANDA TM, OpenHardwareInitiative, OpenTechSummit organizers) to
present the work done w/ the OHANDA trademark and exchange about the
best licenses/trademarks/standards to commonly use during our different
OpenHardware projects to reach the same credibility to this community as
for the OpenSource community.

The panel will be as followed :

**LAW: Open hardware licenses and norms**

• Moderator: Dave Mellis, Arduino & MIT Media Lab• Windell Oskay, Evil
Mad Scientist• Wendy Seltzer, Harvard University: Berkman Center for
Internet & Society• Matt Stack, Liquidware• Michael Weinberg, Public
Knowledge• Peter Brown, Freedom Software Foundation• Xavier Carcelle,
