Here are a few links explaining what we are going to ship in XiVO 14.20:

-   [Roadmap](https://projects.xivo.io/versions/211 "https://projects.xivo.io/versions/211")

New features include:

-   Support for the SPA122 gateway (available in testing at the moment)
-   Asterisk 11.13.1

We also fixed many bugs in the switchboard:

-   a crash
-   some ergonomic improvements when handling calls
-   some weird caller id behavior when transferring calls from the
    switchboard

Work of interest:

-   Function key migration towards our new model keeps going forward
-   A first working development version of
    [xivo-dird](/index.php?post/2014/09/26/XiVO-s-new-directory-server)
    has been completed, but is not yet integrated into XiVO.
