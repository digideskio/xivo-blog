Here are a few links explaining what we are going to ship in XiVO 15.05:

-   [Roadmap](https://projects.xivo.io/versions/221 "https://projects.xivo.io/versions/221")

XiVO 15.05 brings changes into the XiVO Client: visual and functional
changes. Here are some screenshots of the login screen, Xlet people (the
future of all contact lists and searches in the application) and a view
of a "folded" client :

We also added an HTTP REST API interface to xivo-agentd which means you
can now control agent status (login/logout/pause/unpause) from within
your own application.
