Hello everyone,

With the end of this sprint, most of the work on our new personal
contacts system has been completed. We have also continued working on
features already in progress in order to improve and solidify XiVO as a
whole.

### New features in this sprint

-   XiVO Client: Work on personal contacts has continued, brining us
    closer to our goal of merging contact-related features into one
    simple and feature-complete Xlet. New features this sprint include
    editing, importing and exporting personal contacts. They can be
    easily imported/exported with CSV files. Contacts stored in the old
    Personal Directoy Xlet will be automatically migrated to the new
    People Xlet after the upgrade. You can also mass delete all your
    contacts in case of a problem during an importation.

-   Yealink: The firmware for Yealink phones has been upgraded to v80.
    Upgrading the firmware allows us to support the latest models, fix
    bugs and offer new features. These upgrades also add small
    improvements, such as a better display for long names and support
    for searching the XiVO directoy on T4X models.

<!-- -->

-   Codecs: Opus and text codecs are now supported in XiVO. Adding
    codecs enhances the interoperability of VoIP technologies, increases
    the quality of audio, and helps in using less bandwidth. You can
    configure the use of these codecs through the web interface.

### Ongoing features

-   Directories: In the last sprint review, we mentioned our ongoing
    work on unifiying directories. We now want to work on making the new
    contact infrastructure usable by phones. This means that contacts
    coming from different sources, such as an LDAP server, your personal
    contacts, or other people on the same XiVO server, can be
    transparently accessed and used from a phone.

### Technical features

-   Asterisk: Minor upgrade from Asterisk 13.4 to 13.5. This upgrade
    fixes the latest bugs and improves overall stability.

<!-- -->

-   The default password on polycom phones has been changed to 9486,
    which represents 'XIVO' in numeric form. Users are strongly
    encouraged to change this after an installation in order to prevent
    security exploits.

*My fellow xivoists, as the Lord of XiVO allow me to bid you a happy and
invigorating reading. I wish you shall remain in high spirits until our
next fateful encounter, 3 weeks from now. May the freedom of xivo bless
your communications, where ever they may be.*
