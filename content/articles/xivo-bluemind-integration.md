Telephone systems are nice, but it gets even better when they meld into
the computer interfaces that we use to communicate daily. After all, a
big part of our daily lives revolves around email, contacts and agendas.
That is why we are excited to introduce you to Bluemind. BlueMind is a
free-software messaging application that can take care of your emails,
webmail, agendas, contacts, instant messaging, etc.

We are very happy to announce that BlueMind and XiVO can be
interconnected, so that your phone gets easier to use. What happens when
BlueMind is talking to XiVO? You get more features! You may:

-   receive your voicemail messages in your mailbox
-   display your availability and your current phone status
-   see the availability and phone status of your co-workers
-   enable call forwarding by changing your availability status
-   have your availability change automatically, according to your
    agenda
-   make calls from the BlueMind web interface
