Here are a few links explaining what we are going to ship in XiVO 14.23:

-   [Roadmap](https://projects.xivo.io/versions/215 "https://projects.xivo.io/versions/215")

New features include:

-   XiVO Client association with tel: and callto: protocols under
    Windows Vista and up
-   Updated "on waiting calls / logged agents ratio overrun" queue
    diversion configuration
-   Asterisk 11.14.1

We have many new community contributions to the documentation

We also fixed a few bugs

-   a freeze
-   problem associating a voicemail to a sccp device
-   can't Create Online Call Recording Function Key
-   problems in function key migration script

Work of interest:

-   Function key migration towards our new model is nearly over
-   A first working development version of
    [xivo-dird](/index.php?post/2014/09/26/XiVO-s-new-directory-server)
    has been completed, and is now integrated into XiVO.
