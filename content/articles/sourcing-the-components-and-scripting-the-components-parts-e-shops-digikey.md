As I am constantly searching for informations on the different parts
(i.e. components on the PCB), **i have scripted www.digikey.com** (the
HTML form is quite stable) in python in order to automatize the search
on the website.

The script can be found here :
[digikey.py](http://carcelle.fu8.com/digikey.py "digikey.py")

This script can be used like : python digikey.py BC847BVNDITR-ND
(BC847BVNDITR-ND is a part reference on the digikey website).

I am looking for similar that can be used/optimized for the other e-shop
such as Farnell, Mouser, Radiospares in order to have a common script
tool able to search all these e-shops in one and give a report on the
availability for parts in a db run daily or weekly.
