We see currently a great energy and interest for the **OpenHardware
movement** with different groups or consortiums aiming at creating a
common energy in this. The OHANDA Trademark is definitely a great
baseline for the upcoming OpenHardware project to have a legal umbrella
and present their project files in a central repository where the
users/customers of the OHANDA trademark-ed products will be able to find
the documents/files need to understand/modify/improve within the respect
of this trademark.

This week, 2 more news came out in the OpenHardware movement with:

-   A common definition of the OpenHardware 0.3. ^\[<span
    id="rev-pnote-26-1">[1](#pnote-26-1)</span>\]^. The definition is
    derived from the Open Source Definition, which was created by Bruce
    Perens and the Debian developers as the Debian Free Software
    Guidelines

<!-- -->

-   The announcement of the OpenHardwareSummit ^\[<span
    id="rev-pnote-26-2">[2](#pnote-26-2)</span>\]^ to be held the
    September23rd in NYC, US. This event will be supported by Chris
    Anderson (Wired), Mako Hill (OLPC, Wikipedia), Becky Stern (Make),
    Jon Philips (Qi), Shigeru Kobayashi (Gainer), Thinh Nguyen and John
    Wilbanks (CC) and the sponsor of the event (littleBits, Eyebeam).
    Also the people from Creative Commons will be there and that is a
    great news as different people in the OpenHardware community had
    decided to use the CC licence to release the schematics and gerber
    files of their PCBs.

During this event, we will do a presentation of the OHANDA Trademark and
the projects currently under this trademark as we will talk during the
event.
