Fellow Xivoists, the time has come for the release of 15.15. During
thissprint we have fixed many bugs and continued working on
featuressurrounding directories and contacts.

### New features in this sprint

**Voicemail:** The voicemail configuration page has been revamped.
Youcan now configure as many extra parameters as you want in
the"advanced" tab. These parameters will be included along side therest
of the voicemail configuration in asterisk. This new free-formversion of
the voicemail page offers more flexibility to advanced usersof asterisk,
while still keeping it simple enough for regular users.

**People Xlet:** The new People Xlet is now fully integrated into
xivo.We have talked about this xlet in previous sprints, however it
could notbe used without some manual configuration on the server. With
thisrelease, the xlet will work out-of-the-box once it has been added to
aprofile. The People Xlet replaces the old remote directory, which
hasbeen removed.

### Ongoing features

**Directories:** we have started working on a new service that
willintegrate the new directory infrastructure with phones. The goal is
tomake contacts exposed via xivo's directory usable from a user's
phone.This means that bookmarked contacts and a user's personal contacts
willalso be available.

**SIP Lines:** We will be revamping extra parameters for
sipconfiguration in the same way as what has been done for voicemails.
Thiswill make it easier for users to configure advanced features
inasterisk.

### Technical features

-   **Provd:** new plugin for the 6800 series of Mitel phones
    (formerly Aastra)
-   **Directories:** The configuration system for directories
    has changed. More details available in the [upgrade
    notes](http://documentation.xivo.io/en/stable/upgrade/upgrade.html#upgrade-notes "upgrade notes").
-   **XiVO Client:** The XiVO Client has been upgraded to Qt 5.5
-   Certain restrictions regarding voicemails for a user have
    been loosened. More details available in the [upgrade
    notes](http://documentation.xivo.io/en/stable/upgrade/upgrade.html#upgrade-notes "upgrade notes").

My fellow xivoists, as the **Lord of XiVO** allow me to bid you a
happyand invigorating farewell. I wish you shall remain in high spirits
untilour next fateful encounter, 3 weeks from now. May the freedom of
XiVObless your communications across the vast VoIP expanse.
