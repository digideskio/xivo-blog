Our current blog had been dedicated since the beginning to the XiVO IPBX
OpenHardware project.

**We have noticied than the number of followers had been growing** since
the first posts and we like the interest that you have been showing to
the OpenHardware projects. Therefore we have decided to extend this blog
to the XiVO project in general and to **update you on a regular basis on
the XiVO Software solution also** and to merge the informations on both
the hardware and the software on one unique blog (sorted by category to
respect the followers and their wishes of topic), **Thus you will be
able to follow the hardware project as well as the software project and
the VoIP in general**.

**XiVO** is not only a web front-end for Asterisk but a full
distribution on-top of an appliance with open specifications as much as
we can. In this spirit, we keep on in this direction and hope to push
more Open telecommunications projects out-there.
