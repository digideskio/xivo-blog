We had the last slot of the day after the lacie-nas.org talk (excellent
presentation and demonstration from Thomas Monjalon and Simon Guinot)
where it was discussed the idea of opening hardware products and the
relation between hardware manufacturers and embedded software
developers. It becomes clearer and clearer that the OpenSource community
is pushing the hardware manufacturers to open-up their specifications
(UART, GPIOs, JTAG) and allow firmware hackings and add-ons
developments.  
In our case, the hardware will be fully open and documented to allow
community contributions and we have several questions about TDM
extensions of our appliances with other interfaces (analog, wireless,
soundcards ...)
