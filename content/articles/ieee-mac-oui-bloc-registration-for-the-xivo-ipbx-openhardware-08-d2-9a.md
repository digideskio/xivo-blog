We are very pleased to update our followers with the different steps of
the process of design of our **XiVO IPBX OpenHarware**. Most of us work
since several years in the telecommunication field and have been using
extensively MAC Ethernet addresses on numerous networks appliances at
the Layer 2.

Since a network appliance has one/several Ethernet interfaces based on a
MAC (IEEE 802.3 controller) and PHY (Signaling and physical interface to
the Ethernet connector) interfaces, the unique OUI MAC addresses are
stored in a non-volatile memory in the Ethernet chip or in a companion
memory on-board. These unique **IEEE OUI MAC** addresses are usually
transparent for the hardware designer as they are registered by the
MAC/PHY chip manufacturers to IEEE registration office.

In our case, we will have a SoC integrating the IEEE 802.3 MAC
controller and storing the 3 Ethernet MAC addresses in a flash memory.
Therefore we have been registrating our own IEEE MAC OUI bloc to be used
in our different network hardware projects. This IEEE OUI bloc will then
be available publicly with the update of Ethernet sniffer/dissectors
after August 31st 2010.

**This bloc will be 08-D2-9A and the XiVO IPBX OpenHardware will appear
as 08-D2-9A-XX-XX-XX on the Ethernet networks.**

A search on **Proformatique** on [the IEEE OUI and Company\_id search
interface](http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/oui/index.shtml) help to
retrieve the associated informations.
