Hello,

XiVO is a big platform for Unified Communication and our team is
actively improving it, especially by using lot of external great
components like Asterisk. So if you're interested in understanding one
of the major components in Asterisk, Avencall now offers training on
Asterisk 13 in France. Furthermore, you will be in direct contact with
the Avencall team and you can ask about the interaction between Asterisk
