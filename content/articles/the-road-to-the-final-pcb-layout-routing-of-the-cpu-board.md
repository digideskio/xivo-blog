We are now entering the road to the final PCB layout routing of the CPU
board of our XiVO IPBX OpenHardware with the gathering of our schematic
design on the CPU board of our IPBX. The current step is to place the
component, check the package of each component in the library (Lbr in
Eagle), double-check the schematics associated to the layout and prepare
the final routing of the netwire optimized for our 10-layers design. We
will document the BoM step with different posts coming up and namely the
optimization of the components sourcing.
