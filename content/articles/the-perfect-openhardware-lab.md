In an OpenHardware project, making up a perfect lab is crucial in order
to prototype, test and solder parts before going to PCB pre-production
and production.

This post aims at presenting the set-up of the XiVO IPBX OpenHardware
lab at Proformatique.

**The main list of hardware equipment we have in our lab is:**

-   Working-table from Langlois - Gradignan, France (typically used for
    electronic practical session in the secondary schools and
    engineering schools) with wooden table and neon to have a close-up
    working light
-   Oscilloscope Tektronix DP2012 with Ethernet interface (web server
    running on the digital Oscilloscope that can control the settings on
    the 2 ways)
-   Multimeter ChauvinArnoux - CA703 (CAT IV - 600V with the diode
    function used to validate continuity of PCB trace when looking for
    connectivity on a PCB)
-   Weller solder station WD1 with 2.5mm, 1mm and 0.5mm ends
-   2 x PowerSupply PS3003 (24V in order to be able to do 48V with 2
    power-supplies back-to-back)
-   Zooming lens for close-ups soldering and debugging
-   ATX PowerSupply to power motherboard and ATX-based EvaluationBoards
-   Saleae LogicAnalyzer (USB-based and supported with **sigrok** with
    Linux / http://www.sigrok.org/wiki/Main\_Page for the list of
    supported logic analyzers) for data-bus debugging
-   Solderless breadboard SD-24 for wires connexion through the
    breadboard

descrived above:**

This is important to get also small tools like cutting tools, small
wires (like the precious HIRSCHMANN MKL0,64/25-0,25 - reference

soldering wires (RoHS with 1mm and 0.5mm diameter), screw-drivers, SMT
and non SMT resistors, capacitors and selfs, labels for different wire
