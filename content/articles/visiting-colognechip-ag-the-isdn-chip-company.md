We had the pleasure to visit the CologneChip AG engineering team this
week in Koln, Germany and exchange on the ISDN markets and chips (and
the different market penetration of ISDN, FTTH, DOCSIS, xDSL in Europe
countries). ISDN is still strong in Germany w/ 29 Millions subscribers
(22M analog subscribers and 6M subscribers w/ DOSCIS and xDSL - sources:
Bundesnetzagentur) and still allow over the 144Kbits/s of net data rate,
2 bearer channels (B-channels) w/ 64Kbits/s each which is equivalent to
3.4Khz voice channel at 8 ksamples/second. The XiVO IPBX OpenHardware
will propose 4 BRI (also called S0 for point-to-multipoint BRI type)
interfaces to allow these data and voice applications.
