As we are developing an OpenHardware projects/products, it's important
to give some feedbacks of our prototyping process.We are now cabling our
first FXO-FXS prototype boards and moving to test without our own board
connected to our SoC to validate our design on our prototype
motherboard. These pictures illustrates our soldering process with the
1:1 size PCB layout printed-out.

While one is soldering components (mainly some TQFP package chips and
CMS) on the \*blank\* PCB, it's important to have the right tools to put
the components at the right position, solder them (potentially using
some flux to fix the pins of a chip before soldering a whole line of
pins) and verifying the connexion with a loop. Let me give some
references of tools we are usingÂ :

-   A set of high-precision tweezers (farnell\#3972963) to pick and
    place the components
-   A 10x maginifier (farnell\#4681680) to verify the quality of the
    soldering
-   A flux cleaner (farnell\#3916613)
-   A 15ml flux dispenser pen (farnell\#876732)
