**As the XiVO IPBX OpenHardware project moves forward to the production
of our first protoboards** for our internal tests, we are pleased to
give a first display of the PCB board file for the FXO/FXS interfaces on
the IPBX that are routed from the XHFC-4SU controller :

When one designs a PCB, it's requires to create two files in order to
reach the final board ready for production (we will give more posts
about the production files needed for the electronic factories receiving
them once we reach this level of the project) : **the .SCH (Schematics
file with all the electrical connexions between the components and the
chips on-board) and the .BRD (Board file with the actual real-sized PCB
and the components position with all the net connexions**). This image
displays the .BRD file designed for the FXO/FXS interfaces.
